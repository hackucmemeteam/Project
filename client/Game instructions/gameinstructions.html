         	This is a 2 player game. <br>
			The objective of the game is to possess all of the cards. <br>
			Each player starts with half of the deck, facedown. <br>
			Each player then turns over the top card of their deck, and compare them.<br>
			Whoever has the higher number card gets both cards, and puts them at the bottom of the deck. <br>
			If the numbers are the same, the higher suit gets both cards. Spades are the highest, then hearts, then, diamonds, and lastly clubs. <br>
			Repeat by turning over the next two top cards and comparing. <br>
			At the end, whoever gets the most cards wins! <br>
			ENJOY!!<br></h5></center>

         The concept of the game is to get rid of your cards by playing in a circle, valuing high cards
These are the SPECIAL cards (all can be played whenever): 
 <br>
<ul>
  <li> 10’s clear the pile </li>
  <li> 3’s make the next person skip </li>
  <li> 2’s let you play another card </li>
  <li> 7’s require the next player to play a card either higher or lower than 7 (depending on what the player says) </li>
</ul>
<hr>
Everyone starts with 3 cards face down, and 6 cards that they keep<br>
Pick 3 cards out of 6 to put face up on the 3 cards face down <br>
Whoever has the lowest card starts playing by putting a card, and retrieving one from the deck<br>
Next person has to play a card higher than that, and retrieve a card from the deck, and so on <br>
Whoever can’t play anything valid or a special card has to pick up the existing pile <br>
Once the deck runs out and the cards in hand run out, the player can only play from the 3 cards face up. Unless they have to pick up more cards. <br>
When those end, they blindly pick a card to play from the face down. <br>
Whoever loses all of their cards first wins. <br>

         Each player gets 2 cards. The values of faces are 10, aces are 11, and number cards are their respective value. <br>
         If the sum = 21, you automatically are one winner. <br>
         If the sum exceeds 21, you automatically lose. <br>
         If your sum is less than 21, you have the option of either keeping your sum, or adding another card, risking getting over 21. <br>
         After everyone is done, whoever has the number closest to 21 wins. <br>

         Texas hold 'em (also known as Texas holdem, hold 'em, and holdem) is a variation of the card game of poker. <br> Two cards, known as the hole cards, are dealt face down to each player, and then five community cards are dealt face up in three stages. <br>The stages consist of a series of three cards ("the flop"), later an additional single card ("the turn" or "fourth street"), and a final card ("the river" or "fifth street").  <br> Each player seeks the best five card poker hand from the combination of the community cards and their own hole cards.  <br> If a player's best five card poker hand consists only of the five community cards and none of the player's hole cards, it is called "playing the board".  <br> Players have betting options to check, call, raise, or fold.  <br> Rounds of betting take place before the flop is dealt and after each subsequent deal. <br>
