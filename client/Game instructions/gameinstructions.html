         	This is a 2 player game. <br>
			The objective of the game is to possess all of the cards. <br>
			Each player starts with half of the deck, facedown. <br>
			Each player then turns over the top card of their deck, and compare them.<br>
			Whoever has the higher number card gets both cards, and puts them at the bottom of the deck. <br>
			If the numbers are the same, the higher suit gets both cards. Spades are the highest, then hearts, then, diamonds, and lastly clubs. <br>
			Repeat by turning over the next two top cards and comparing. <br>
			At the end, whoever gets the most cards wins! <br>
			ENJOY!!<br></h5></center>

         The concept of the game is to get rid of your cards by playing in a circle, valuing high cards
These are the SPECIAL cards (all can be played whenever): 
 <br>
<ul>
  <li> 10’s clear the pile </li>
  <li> 3’s make the next person skip </li>
  <li> 2’s let you play another card </li>
  <li> 7’s require the next player to play a card either higher or lower than 7 (depending on what the player says) </li>
</ul>
<hr>
Everyone starts with 3 cards face down, and 6 cards that they keep<br>
Pick 3 cards out of 6 to put face up on the 3 cards face down <br>
Whoever has the lowest card starts playing by putting a card, and retrieving one from the deck<br>
Next person has to play a card higher than that, and retrieve a card from the deck, and so on <br>
Whoever can’t play anything valid or a special card has to pick up the existing pile <br>
Once the deck runs out and the cards in hand run out, the player can only play from the 3 cards face up. Unless they have to pick up more cards. <br>
When those end, they blindly pick a card to play from the face down. <br>
Whoever loses all of their cards first wins. <br>

         Each player gets 2 cards. The values of faces are 10, aces are 11, and number cards are their respective value. <br>
         If the sum = 21, you automatically are one winner. <br>
         If the sum exceeds 21, you automatically lose. <br>
         If your sum is less than 21, you have the option of either keeping your sum, or adding another card, risking getting over 21. <br>
         After everyone is done, whoever has the number closest to 21 wins. <br>

         Texas hold 'em (also known as Texas holdem, hold 'em, and holdem) is a variation of the card game of poker. <br> Two cards, known as the hole cards, are dealt face down to each player, and then five community cards are dealt face up in three stages. <br>The stages consist of a series of three cards ("the flop"), later an additional single card ("the turn" or "fourth street"), and a final card ("the river" or "fifth street").  <br> Each player seeks the best five card poker hand from the combination of the community cards and their own hole cards.  <br> If a player's best five card poker hand consists only of the five community cards and none of the player's hole cards, it is called "playing the board".  <br> Players have betting options to check, call, raise, or fold.  <br> Rounds of betting take place before the flop is dealt and after each subsequent deal. <br>

         <p>In casual play, the right to deal a hand typically rotates among the players and is marked by a token called a dealer button (or buck). In a casino, a house dealer handles the cards for each hand, but the button (typically a white plastic disk) is rotated clockwise among the players to indicate a nominal dealer to determine the order of betting. The cards are dealt clockwise around the poker table, one at a time.</p>
<p>One or more players are usually required to make forced bets, usually either an ante or a blind bet (sometimes both). The dealer shuffles the cards, the player on the chair to his right cuts, and the dealer deals the appropriate number of cards to the players one at a time, beginning with the player to his left. Cards may be dealt either face-up or face-down, depending on the variant of poker being played. After the initial deal, the first of what may be several betting rounds begins. Between rounds, the players' hands develop in some way, often by being dealt additional cards or replacing cards previously dealt. At the end of each round, all bets are gathered into the central pot.</p>
<p>At any time during a betting round, if one player bets, no opponents choose to call (match) the bet, and all opponents instead fold, the hand ends immediately, the bettor is awarded the pot, no cards are required to be shown, and the next hand begins. This is what makes bluffing possible. Bluffing is a primary feature of poker, one that distinguishes it from other vying games and from other games that make use of poker hand rankings.</p>
<p>At the end of the last betting round, if more than one player remains, there is a showdown, in which the players reveal their previously hidden cards and evaluate their hands. The player with the best hand according to the poker variant being played wins the pot. A poker hand comprises five cards; in variants where a player has more than five cards available to them, only the best five-card combination counts.</p>
