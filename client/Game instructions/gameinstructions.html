<h3>War</h3>
<p>
This is a 2 player game. <br>
The objective of the game is to possess all of the cards. <br>
Each player starts with half of the deck, facedown. <br>
Each player then turns over the top card of their deck, and compare them.<br>
Whoever has the higher number card gets both cards, and puts them at the bottom of the deck. Jacks correspond to 11, queens are 12, kings are 13, and aces are 14. <br>
If the numbers are the same, the higher suit gets both cards. Spades are the highest, then hearts, then, diamonds, and lastly clubs. <br>
Repeat by turning over the next two top cards and comparing. <br>
At the end, whoever gets the most cards wins! <br>
ENJOY!!<br>
