         	This is a 2 player game. <br>
			The objective of the game is to possess all of the cards. <br>
			Each player starts with half of the deck, facedown. <br>
			Each player then turns over the top card of their deck, and compare them.<br>
			Whoever has the higher number card gets both cards, and puts them at the bottom of the deck. <br>
			If the numbers are the same, the higher suit gets both cards. Spades are the highest, then hearts, then, diamonds, and lastly clubs. <br>
			Repeat by turning over the next two top cards and comparing. <br>
			At the end, whoever gets the most cards wins! <br>
			ENJOY!!<br></h5></center>

         The concept of the game is to get rid of your cards by playing in a circle, valuing high cards
These are the SPECIAL cards (all can be played whenever): 
 <br>
<ul>
  <li> 10’s clear the pile </li>
  <li> 3’s make the next person skip </li>
  <li> 2’s let you play another card </li>
  <li> 7’s require the next player to play a card either higher or lower than 7 (depending on what the player says) </li>
</ul>
<hr>
Everyone starts with 3 cards face down, and 6 cards that they keep<br>
Pick 3 cards out of 6 to put face up on the 3 cards face down <br>
Whoever has the lowest card starts playing by putting a card, and retrieving one from the deck<br>
Next person has to play a card higher than that, and retrieve a card from the deck, and so on <br>
Whoever can’t play anything valid or a special card has to pick up the existing pile <br>
Once the deck runs out and the cards in hand run out, the player can only play from the 3 cards face up. Unless they have to pick up more cards. <br>
When those end, they blindly pick a card to play from the face down. <br>
Whoever loses all of their cards first wins. <br>
